        <p>Valencell was thus able to focus on what they do best, while ST’s components took care of the rest. Dr. LeBoeuf’s teams provided its outstanding optical sensor systems and algorithms that are responsible for some of the most accurate heart rate monitoring on wearable devices in the market, while SensorTile handles all the other physical activity recognition and the Bluetooth connection to a mobile device. Furthermore, because all the sensors use either I2C or a UART communication path, engineers end up getting a simple and efficient design that gives them a quick and simpler access to the sensors’ information.</p>
